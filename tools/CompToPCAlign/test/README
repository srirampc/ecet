Test Cases
----------
Each test case has 3 files of the format
1. true_<caseid>.er , the true edits
2. corr_<caseid>.er , the corrected edits 
   given by an Error Correction pgm.
unmap.er remains the same in all cases

Each case handles both when the correction is matching with true
output and when it doesn't match

The following test case numbers are used
|--------------------------------+--------------+----+----+----|
| Case                           |           Id | TN | FP | FN |
|--------------------------------+--------------+----+----+----|
| Substitutions - single/mult    |            1 |  4 |  1 |  3 |
| Insertion - single             |            2 |  2 |  1 |  1 |
| Insertion - multiple           |            3 |  4 |  2 |  3 |
| Deletion - single              |            " |  4 |  2 |  3 |
| Deletion - multiple            |            4 |  5 |  1 |  1 |
| Insertion followed by Deletion |            5 |    |    |    |
| Multiple Ins followed by Del   | Not required |    |    |    |
| Deletion followed by Insertion |            6 |    |    |    |
| Multiple Del followed by Ins   |            7 |    |    |    |
| Ins followed by Sub            |            8 |    |    |    |
| Del followed by Sub            |            9 |    |    |    |

Insertion followed by Deletion will not work. But I am not fixing
until i find that Coral actually fixes insertion/deletion.
